This repo contains my cumulative work from the Northeastern University's course "EECE5554: Robotic Sensing and Navigation." 
The course description can be seen below to get a sense of the topics covered.

"Examines the actual sensors and mathematical techniques for robotic sensing and navigation with a focus on sensors such as cameras, sonars, and laser scanners. 
These are used in association with techniques and algorithms for dead reckoning and visual inertial odometry in conjunction with GPS and inertial measurement units. 
Covers Kalman filters and particle filters as applied to the SLAM problem.
A large component of the class involves programming in both the ROS and LCM environments with real field robotics sensor data sets. 
Labs incorporate real field sensors and platforms. 
Culminates with both an individual design project and a team-based final project of considerable complexity."
